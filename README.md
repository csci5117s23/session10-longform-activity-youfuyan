# Session 10

The purpose of this activity is to practice getting all the recent "advanced bits" hooked together. You can work on this indivisually, or as a group. It's just practice so it won't be graded, but do try to complete it as a matter of practice.

The activity here is for you to:

1. Set up a flask project
2. Set up render hosting
3. Hook in useful templating
4. Hook in a database
5. Hook in auth0 login
6. Discover how to connect auth0 login to the database.

Your goal is to build out the _strucutral parts_ of a common feature: new user info site. You need:

* A home page. This can be as simple as the word "home" on a page, although it should have a place for a login button
* A log in button -- that logs the user in sucessfully
* When logged in -- don't show the log in, show their name and a log out button
* (the logout button should work)
* The first time (and only the first time) a user logs in theys hould be taken to an info page (this can just say "info" and be a link to home

As you work -- take notes on the _parts_ of this stack -- there's a lot of setup work, and it pays to remember it all!
